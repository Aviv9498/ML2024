* In assignment 1, we will build models to predict student's performance. We will be using the "Student Performance Dataset" a dataset which includes student grades, demographic, social and school related features that has been collected by using school reports and questionnaires.
Our target value will be the student's performance in the end of the year which is marked 'G3' in the dataset. In the first part of the assignment we will be writing a linear regression model to predict the students grade at the end of the year. In the second part of the assignment we will build a classifier which predicts if the student's performance at the end of the year will be above average.
